Algorithm to generate dual surface bound by primal edge loop L

Construct primal spanning tree T spanning primal vertices.
T = T U S_e
0) Find all edges satisfying all these conditions
1) adding the edge to T closes a cycle around a dual edge.
2) The dual edge closed is not adjacent to the primary singular loop L and is also not adjacent to the boundary
3) T = T U E
4) if E != 0, goto 0

draw primal spanning tree excluding boundary edges.
close primal loop for triangle faces adj to boundary if it has only 1 primal edge left.

If a triangle face has 2 edges in the spanning tree, the dual edge corresponding to the triangle face is guaranteed to be a boundary of the dual surface.
A dual edge can only be a boundary of the dual surface if it's adjacent to the curve or adj to boundary. This means a triangle face with one edge open must have vertices on the boundary or curve.
All triangles need to have at least 1 filled in edge in order to be manifold
maybe we need a spanning face tree that spans edges?? though that's not a graph.

resulting dual surface needs to be bounded by curves that are closely adjacent to the boundary and primal curve. meaning triangles are exempt from being in the tree only if they have 2 vertices on the boundary/curve.

Any exempt triangle results in nonmanifold-ness.

boundary primal edges being included in the tree results in no non-manifoldness near the boundary.

We want every triangle to have 0 untreed edges unless it has 2 untreed edges, 
It can have just 1 untreed edge iff it shares verts on the boundary or curve. 
No dual surface has no boundary. That would correspond to the dual cell surface of a primal vertex, but since all vertices are spanned by the tree, an entire dual cell can't be part of the dual surface.

need a protocol to handle primal faces with no edges in the tree. Maybe create a different kind of tree that always takes an edge of every triangle.
so spans half edges? 

finally after some bugs, arrived at a half reasonable result.
Used boundary less primal tree, followed by adding in the boundary.
result is a surface that mostly wraps the curve itself, without interacting with boundary
except when very close to it.

What's needed to fix this issue, is probably primal edges added to the tree in a non twisting manner from the curve.
unsure if they should be added before or after the primal tree is constructed. but the idea is it cuts the dual surface wrapping the curve 
so it cant bound itself. Another thought is to create the primal surface first, and add that to the tree (before or after). this stops the dual surface from closing on itself.

add the curve to the tree
Non manifold locations are described by both primal tets and primal triangles.
primal triangles with no edges in the tree, or primal tets with 1 or 2 adj edges in tree. maybe some other primal tet conditions.

Can include entire toilet paper roll around the singular curve. and also probably can be non manifold.
1) include the entire cylinder in primal edges. this probably involves building the tree without these edges and not allowing these edges to be added in. The result is a disconnected tree? hav to be careful about that.
2) visualize boundary dual edges.

*************** pretty good results so far.
Provable or well understood aspects are that due to the spanning tree connecting all interior vertices, non manifold locations are very limited. The final dual surface can't separate the interior vertices. The only locations where it could happen are at the boundary vertices, which is strictly because the tree doesn't include boundary vertices to begin with. 
The cone of edges adj to the curve that we initialize to not be in the tree will never be filled in the zipping of the tree. because each of those triangles adj to the curve have at least 2 edges adj to the curve. this guarantees edges of these triangles will never be added to the tree.
The dual surface that results wraps the curve in a cylinder, and then extends to the boundary.

In the torus case or higher genus case, the final solution can contain a union of the dual surface as well as surfaces that cut the mesh into a ball. Image of example attached.

Remains to add other singularities to avoid. Probably need to add before generating tree.
